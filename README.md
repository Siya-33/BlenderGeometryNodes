# BlenderGeometryNodes

This repo contains Geometry nodes generating the images shown below. Most scenes are downloadable on my [gumroad](https://siya33.gumroad.com/). I also make some tutorials randomly on [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/333322096)

There are some awesome GN toolsets which can save you a lot of time but need some fundenmetal knowledge, such as [bradley](https://bradley-animations.gumroad.com/l/jSyDM), [Erindale](https://erindale.gumroad.com/l/erintools) and [Higgsas](https://higgsas.gumroad.com/l/wrusot).
