# BlenderGeometryNodes

This repo contains Geometry nodes generating the images shown below. Most scenes are downloadable on my [gumroad](https://siya33.gumroad.com/). I also make some tutorials randomly on [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/333322096)

There are some awesome GN toolsets which can save you a lot of time but need some fundenmetal knowledge, such as [bradley](https://bradley-animations.gumroad.com/l/jSyDM), [Erindale](https://erindale.gumroad.com/l/erintools) and [Higgsas](https://higgsas.gumroad.com/l/wrusot).

**Most projects can work fine in 3.3+.**

If the vertical slope must be vertical, you can use the cross product of the tangentand normal vectors, but that will cause crossing. It’s okay if the direction is the same, but there will be big problems if they don’t. In short, you can’t have both
